# Doubling

### `TASK`

Write a function `double_items(ns)` that given a list of integers `ns` updates the list so that every element is doubled. The list `ns` should be edited in place, meaning that there should be no return value. 

#### USAGE

```python
>>> ns = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> double_items(ns)
>>> ns
[2, 4, 6, 8]
```
